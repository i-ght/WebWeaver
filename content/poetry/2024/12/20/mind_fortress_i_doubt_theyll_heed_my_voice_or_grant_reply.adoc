== Mind Fortress: I Doubt They'll Heed My Voice or Grant Reply

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
I poured my heart out
And hoped for communication in return.
Instead, I'm met with silence.
Instead of responding to my message,
You put up your old rusty mental barriers
And ran away to the safe space inside your skull.
Farewell, friend, I guess.

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
I poured my heart forth, yearning for a voice,
A spark of warmth, a kindred spirit’s touch.
Yet silence greets me, cold as winter’s breath,
In place of words, a void that echoes deep.
I doubt they’ll heed my voice, nor grant reply.
For in their minds, a fortress thou hast built,
Thou hast erected mind barriers of old,
Rusty shields that guard thy heart from the world,
And fled to realms where comfort reigns alone,
Safely shielded with walls of cold disdain,
Within the fortress of thy guarded mind,
While I, exposed, lay bare my wounded heart.
Farewell, dear friend, for now I take my leave,
A wanderer amidst the shadows cast,
In search of solace where the heart may speak,
And find a kindred soul to share the weight.
