== December is a Scam in Florida

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
Florida is fucking bullshit.
It's the middle of god damned December and we're sitting at 80 degrees right now; it's humid as all fucking hell.
What is this fucking bullshit?
This is the biggest scam of a December I've ever had the displeasure to experience!
Weather, who the hell do you think you are?!

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
In Florida, where the sun reigns supreme,
December arrives, yet warmth persists--
Eighty degrees--a mockery of winter;
Humidity wraps around like a heavy shroud.
What is this deception, this betrayal of season?
The air thick with moisture, stifling and relentless.
Where is the chill that should accompany this time?
The festive spirit feels misplaced, out of sync.
Nature, in its whimsy, plays a cruel game,
Mocking expectations with its sultry embrace.
In this land of palm and endless summer,
I search for solace, for a hint of winter's grace.
Yet amidst the discomfort, I find a flicker,
A reminder that joy can exist in the heat,
In laughter shared, in moments of connection,
Even when the weather defies all reason.
