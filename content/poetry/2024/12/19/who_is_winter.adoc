== Who is Winter?

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
The closer you get to Winter solstice, the earlier it gets dark.
Beyond solstice, it gradually gets lighter later and later.
The light begins temporarily overpoweringly devouring the darkness.
Before, the dark was temporarily overpoweringly devouring the light.
The light and darkness are light gigantic mouths!
At any given time, one mouth is kissing the other with more intense passionate power!
As we near the turning point, the solstice, the darkness appears to be winning--to smother and snuff out the light for good!
The darkness is kissing the light harder than the light can kiss back!
Now, the turning point strikes!
The light is now kissing the darkness harder than the darkness can kiss back!
The light lets the darkness dominate,
Then, the darkness let's the light win!
They take turns!

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
In winter's grasp, as shadows stretch and creep,
The sun retreats, its golden rays subdued,
And darkness, like a cloak, enfolds the earth,
With every passing hour, it claims its reign.
Yet lo! The solstice, that fateful turning point,
Where light and dark in fervent dance engage,
A struggle fierce, as if two titans clash,
Each seeking mastery o'er the other’s realm.
The darkness, bold, with ravenous embrace,
Doth devour light, as night consumes the day,
Its breath a chill that whispers of despair,
Yet in this gloom, a flicker still remains.
For light, though waning, holds a spark within,
A promise whispered in the silent dark,
That soon the dawn shall break, and shadows flee,
As day returns to claim its rightful throne.
Thus, in this cosmic waltz, they intertwine,
Two mouths that kiss with passion’s fierce delight,
The light, though dimmed, prepares to rise anew,
While darkness, spent, concedes its fleeting hold.
And so they dance, in cycles evermore,
Each taking turns, as seasons shift and sway,
In harmony, they weave the fabric bright,
Of life, of death, of night, and day’s embrace.
O muse, inspire this tale of light and dark,
Of battles fought in silence, unseen wars,
For in their clash, the universe unfolds,
A testament to balance, ever sought.
As winter wanes, and spring begins to bloom,
The light shall reign, yet darkness shall return,
In endless rhythm, nature’s grand design,
Where both shall kiss, and neither shall be lost.

== Couplets

I.
“Come hither, little light,” the darkness said with glee;
“Into my shadowed realm, you’ll find a place for thee.
The way into my kingdom is through the night so deep,
And I have so many secrets that in the silence I do keep.”
“Oh no, no!” the little light replied, “I cannot stay with you,
For those who dwell within your dark can never break it through.”

II.
“I see you’re weary, shining bright, from soaring through the sky,
Will you rest within my gentle shade?” the darkness whispered nigh.
“There are soft and silken shadows where you can lay your head,
And if you choose to linger here, I’ll wrap you in my thread.”
“Oh no, no!” the little light exclaimed, “I’ve heard the tales of old,
That those who sleep within your grasp are lost to icy cold.”

III.
Said the cunning darkness to the light, “Dear friend, what can I do,
To show the deep affection I have always felt for you?
I have within my depths a treasure, secrets dark and rare;
I’m sure you’ll find them lovely—will you come and see them there?”
“Oh no, no!” the little light replied, “I cannot venture near,
For I’ve heard what lies within your depths, and I shall not draw too near.”

IV.
“Sweet creature!” said the darkness, “you’re radiant and so wise.
How lovely are your golden rays, how bright your shining eyes!
I have a mirror in my depths, where you can see your glow,
If you will step a moment in, I promise you’ll not go.”
“I thank you, gentle shadow,” she said, “for what you’ve said to me,
But I must bid you now farewell, and seek the light so free.”

V.
The darkness turned away and smiled, for well it knew the game,
That soon the little light would come, enchanted by its claim.
So it wove a subtle web of night, in corners dark and sly,
And set the stage to catch the light, to dim its brilliant sky.
Then it sang a haunting tune, with whispers soft and low,
“Come hither, hither, little light, to where the shadows grow;
Your rays are bright and dazzling, your warmth a sweet delight,
But come and rest within my arms, and I will hold you tight.”

[%hardbreaks]
VI.
Alas, alas! how soon the little light, so bold,
Hearing the flattering whispers, came drifting through the cold;
With shimmering rays it hovered near, then closer drew in flight,
Thinking only of the shadows, and the comfort of the night;
Thinking only of the dark embrace—poor foolish thing!—at last,
Up jumped the cunning darkness, and held her in its grasp.

[%hardbreaks]
VII.
It drew her down into its depths, into its shadowed den,
Within its darkened kingdom—yet she ne’er came out again!
And now, dear little children, who may this tale behold,
To flattering words and shadowed charms, I pray you be not sold:
To an evil counselor, close heart, and ear, and eye,
And take a lesson from this tale, of the Light and the Dark’s sly lie.
