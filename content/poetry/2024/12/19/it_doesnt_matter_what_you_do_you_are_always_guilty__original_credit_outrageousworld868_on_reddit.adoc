=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
In life’s vast stage, each soul must play a part,
Yet every choice invites a harsh critique.
A person lacks a degree, they hear,
“Why did you not pursue the path of school?”
But if a degree is earned, the voice shifts,
“Yet many hold this paper; stand apart!”
An internship is sought, yet doors are closed,
“Experience is needed; how can you thrive?”
If one finds a place, the judgment returns,
“Not real work, you see; it lacks the weight.”
A healthy body faces scornful eyes,
“How dare you struggle when others bear more?”
Yet those who bear a burden face the blame,
“Your plight is yours alone; you must endure.”
A job that pays too little brings disdain,
“Complain not, for some seek with empty hands.”
The jobless face a different kind of scorn,
“A red flag raised; your worth is now in doubt.”
A worker in the trades meets fierce rebuke,
“Your labor’s common; many can do this.”
In offices, the suits all gather round,
“Why not pursue a trade? It’s more secure.”
The young are told their minds are yet unformed,
While age brings whispers of a fading spark.
Experience can turn to heavy chains,
“Overqualified; the market’s not for you.”
And those with little skill are met with sneers,
“Your lack of knowledge marks you as unfit.”
Thus in this world, where judgments never cease,
Each path we take is met with bitter words.
We all are players in this endless game,
Bound by the weight of others’ harsh demands.
