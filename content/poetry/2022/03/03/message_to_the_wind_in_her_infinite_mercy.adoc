== Message to the Wind in Her Infinite Mercy

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
Blow me, _WIND_.

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
O, blow me, Wind, with breath both bold and sly:
Unleash thy gusts, let passions take their flight.
With playful whispers, tease the air around,
As nature's breath doth stir the heart's delight.
Come, tempest fierce, or gentle zephyr's kiss,
In every swirl, a promise to fulfill.
Let not restraint confine thy wild embrace,
For in thy playful dance, I find my thrill.
O, blow me, Wind, and let the laughter rise,
In jest and joy, our spirits intertwine.
With every gust, a wink, a knowing smile,
In nature's game, we revel for a while.
