== I Pray To God I Lose My Job

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
I want to lose my shit job.
Go talk to the Lord Off The All The Land:
"Greetings Your Lordship,
I live to serve and bow down before you.
I lost my shit job;
I'm not giving you another fucking dime of your stupid fucking rent money.
This is my house now,
Call the fucking cops,
Evict me.
I love this building so much it'll always be mine now.

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
O, I beseech thee, Lord of all the land,
With humble heart, I come before thy throne:
"Greetings, Your Lordship, I, thy servant here,
Once bowed in reverence, now stand defiant.
I've lost my wretched toil, my burdens cast,
And I shall pay thee not another dime
Of that accursed rent, thy greedy claim.
This dwelling, once thy realm, is mine alone;
I stake my claim upon these hallowed walls.
Call forth the constables, let them approach,
And seek to cast me from this sacred space.
For love of this abode, I stand resolvedâ€”
It shall forever be my rightful home."
