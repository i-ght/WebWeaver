== Purple

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
Purple acts funny when touching dark!
Purple acts funny when touched light! (ew)
Purple does both, there is no discrimination left.
I like purple!
Purple is funny!
Such a funny act!
My favorite is purple!
I'm purple!

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
When purple hues do dance 'neath shadow's touch,
They play the fool, a jest upon the dark.
Yet when the light doth grace their vibrant form,
They twist and turn: a spectacle of mirth.
No bias found in purple's lively guise,
For both the dark and light it doth embrace.
I find delight in purple's playful ways,
A jester's heart within its royal shade.
Such antics bring a smile to weary souls,
My fondest hue, the one I claim as mineâ€”
In purple's realm, I find my spirit's joy.
