== Witchcraft

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
At least after you are burned to ashes
You just blow around in the wind
Don't have to feel much anymore
Thank you Catholics
for burning me and calling me a "Witch"
You're all so holy now

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
At last, when turned to ashes, I shall find
Myself adrift upon the restless wind,
No longer bound by earthly pain or strife.
O thank thee, Catholics, for thy cruel hand,
For branding me a "Witch" in fervent zeal,
As if thy piety could cleanse the sin.
In flames, I rise, transcending mortal chains,
While thou, so holy, cast thy stones with glee.
Yet in this fate, I find a strange release,
For ashes scattered dance in freedom's breath,
And mock the judgments of thy "righteous" hearts.
