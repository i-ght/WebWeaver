== You're Going Home

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
When you die,
I'm gonna dig you up and
Take you to the crematorium.
Then, I'm gonna rub your ashes all over my body
And eat them up.
You're going home.

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
When you depart this world, I shall not rest;
I'll seek your form beneath the earth's embrace.
With careful hands, I'll unearth your remains,
And bear you forth to where the flames consume.
In that fierce heat, your essence shall be freed--
Transformed to ash--a whisper of your soul.
I'll take those remnants, rub them on my skin:
A final bond--a union forged in fire.
And in that act, I'll taste the memory:
Each grain a fragment of the life you lived.
You'll journey with me--woven into flesh--
Returning home: where love and loss entwine.
