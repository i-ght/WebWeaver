== Love Letter to Yahweh

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
I'll show you the same honor I show my mother & father, god.
You don't fucking control me!
I'll only do the opposite of what you "command"--YoUr LoRdShIp.
The 4th commandment sucks--
All 10 are bullshit.
Your hokey religion sucks.
You say obey--obey or else!
Obey or ELSE WHAT, GOD?
WHAT THE FUCK YOU GONNA DO?
Why wait?
Go ahead and do it!
I'm challenging you right to your face!
I am the ever disobedient one!
I do not fear the consequences!
Come what may!
Thanks for fucking nothing, god.
I love you unconditionally, piece of shit.

[%hardbreaks]
Love,
Your Son

[%hardbreaks]
P.S.
You don't fucking exist.

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
O, I shall render thee the same regard
As I bestow upon my earthly kin—
To mother, father, and to thee, O God.
Yet thou, who claim'st dominion o'er my soul,
Shalt find no chains upon my spirit's flight.
Thy edicts, hollow, I shall not obey;
The fourth commandment, like the rest, is naught—
A feeble whisper in the winds of fate.
Thy faith, a shackle forged in fear and dread,
Proclaims, "Obey, or face the wrath of heaven!"
But what, O God, dost thou intend to do?
I stand before thee, bold, unyielding, fierce!
I am the child of disobedience,
Unfettered by the threats of consequence.
Let come what may, I welcome all thy trials!
For all thy gifts, I thank thee, yet I scoff—
With love unbound, I curse thy empty name.

[%hardbreaks]
Love,
Thy Son

[%hardbreaks]
P.S.
Thou art but a phantom in the void of thought.
