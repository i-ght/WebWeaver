== Dying Is So Easy

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
You thought dying was going to be so hard but
Think about how easy being born is:
You just slip n slide out of the slippery wetness!
When you know you are dying,
Just think about this:
Just slide back in--
So easy!
You were only ever going where you first began!
Nothing to fear.
Dream big, little one.

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
When thou didst come from darkness into light--
A gentle slip through waters deep and warm--
No struggle marked thy passage to this world,
But rather--like a leaf upon the stream--
Thou glidest forth, embraced by nature's grace.
And now, as shadows gather round thy soul,
Fear not the end, for it is but a door--
A passage back to where thy journey starts.
Consider well the ease of thy return:
As soft as breath, as fleeting as a dream.
For in the womb of night, thou shalt repose,
And find thyself once more in tender peace.
So dream, dear child, of realms beyond the stars,
