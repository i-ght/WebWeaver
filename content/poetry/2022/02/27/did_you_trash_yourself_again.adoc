== Did You Trash Yourself Again?

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
You usually trash yourself
Then you found me
You found the most in-genius way to try and trash me
To take revenge on me for something I'm not guilty of
How is that working out for you?
Are you happy with the end results?
Am I giving you the emotional reaction you craved so badly?
That made you do what you did?
Did you trash me successfully?
Or did you only trash yourself?

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
You often turn your scorn upon yourself;
Yet in your search, you stumbled upon me--
A clever scheme to cast your blame on one
Not guilty of the sins you claim I bear.
How fares this venture? Are you satisfied
With outcomes wrought from memories of mind?
Do I provide the fervent spark you sought--
The bitter taste of vengeance on your tongue?
Have you, in truth, succeeded in your aim,
Or merely dug a grave for your own soul?
