== You May Take Your Silence With You To The Graveyard

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
Do you say that you're too insufferable to myself inside yourself without saying it out loud to myself?
I will say this much out loud: I will suffer you through & through.
I have to suffer myself.
Compared with that, suffering you isn't any trouble at all.
There isn't much left for me to say.
Come suffer with me and complain about it out loud--if you want--
Or you may take your silence with you to the graveyard.

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
Do I speak to myself in silent thoughts,
A truth I keep hidden, heavy within?
I bear the weight of you, a shared burden,
Yet in this suffering, I find strange peace.
I voice my thoughts aloud, a quiet vow:
To endure your presence, through every trial.
For in the depths of self, I wrestle pain,
And yours, it seems, is but a fleeting shade.
What more is there to say in this exchange?
Come, let us share our burdens, voice our woes,
Or choose the silence that the graveyard holds,
A quiet pact with shadows, still and cold.
In this communion, we may find our truth,
A connection forged in fires of grief.
So suffer with me, if you choose to stay,
Or take your silence, let it guide your way.
