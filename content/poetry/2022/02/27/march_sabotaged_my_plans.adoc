== March Sabotaged My Plans

=== Freestyle

[%hardbreaks]
All temperature feels the same now.
I like taking snow naps the best.
I took a snow nap the other night;
I stood up and spooked the coyote couple.
I only wanted to say hi,
Didn't want to scare.
Hello long lost trickster sisters & brothers!
I like taking snow naps in the forest at night!
04:00 A.M.
Like all "normal" men do.
But wait the snow is going bye bye!
Nooo come back, anything but March!
The snow starts to fade more and fall less.
I wanted to take a dirt nap in the snow--
A snow dirt nap.
March sabotaged my plans.

=== Blank Verse

[%hardbreaks]
In winter's grasp, where silence reigns supreme,
I sought repose beneath the moon's soft glow.
A snow nap taken, wrapped in frosty white--
Where dreams entwined with whispers of the night.
Yet a stir broke the stillness, two shadows in the glade--
A coyote pair--caught in the twilight.
With gentle heart I wished to greet the kin
But they startled and vanished into the dark.
"O trickster spirits, lost in time's embrace,
I call to thee, in this enchanted space.
For in the forest deep, where secrets lie,
I find my solace 'neath the starlit sky."
But hark! The season shifts, as March draws near,
The snow retreats, and with it, fades my cheer.
"Come back, sweet winter, with your blanket pure,
For dirt naps in the snow, my heart's allure."
Yet March, the rogue, with fickle hand does play,
And steals my dreams of white, to melt away.
A snow dirt nap, a vision now undone,
As spring encroaches and the cold does run.
Thus, in this verse, I mourn the fleeting chill,
For in the heart of winter, time stands still.
Yet as the seasons turn, I must abide,
And find new dreams where snow and warmth collide.
